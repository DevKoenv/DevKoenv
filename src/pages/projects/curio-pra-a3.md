## Context
Although the city calls itself a "Smart City," many processes are very outdated; for example, most of the city's
administration of the city is still kept in Excel or CSV files. In order to make things a little more 'smart
processing of those files needs to be automated. Think of the calculation of
all kinds of totals and averages, such as the total amount of parking fines, or the average age of all the
officials in the city. This kind of information is important for city government.

Therefore, the automation department at Smart City City Hall temporarily needs extra hands. Each
student team is assigned one assignment. The programmers working at City Hall will be
available to answer questions and will eventually take delivery of the programs.

## Project Reflection
My Python assignment was challenging because I had to work alone. My teammate Joek was unreachable and didn't show up once. He didn't do anything at all even though it was a group assignment. It is frustrating because I had to do all the work alone while he should also take responsibility. 

My Python assignment was not that difficult because I already knew a little about the topic. It was difficult though because I had to work alone. I got to choose my own group because I was the last one left in the wheel. I chose Joek, because he already knew a bit about Python. Unfortunately, I already had an inkling that he wouldn't do much, and that turned out to be true. He didn't go to school once and didn't do anything at all for the assignment. I liked working without him, though, because he always only half-finishes everything. So I turned in my practical assignment without him. I'm glad I was able to complete it on my own.

Although I didn't learn that much from the assignment because I already knew a lot about Python, I did learn something about how to learn more from future assignments. I am going to create a schedule, log and wireframe/flowchart the same way in the future so that I can learn more from the assignment. I am also going to do less next time because my teammate should also contribute something. It is important for everyone in a group to contribute so that we can learn and grow together. I am determined to be better prepared next time and make sure my teammates do their best too.
